        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <hr>
        <u style="font-size: 18px">Hobbies</u><br>
        One of my hobbies that I like to do in my free time is playing video games.
        While it is quite an unoriginal answer, there is a reason why many people find it so entertaining.
        It is a great way for me to de-stress and experience beautiful storytelling and gameplay. Some of my favorite
        games are:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Elden Ring
            </li>
            <li>
                Skyrim
            </li>
            <li>
                Dishonored
            </li>
            <li>
                League of Legends
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <u style="font-size: 18px">Interests</u><br>
        Aside from my hobbies, I do have many things that I am interested in. One of the things I am interested in is
        fitness. While I do like to play games,
        I also like to exercise. Here are some of my favorite sports/activities in order:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Swimming
            </li>
            <li>
                Going to the gym
            </li>
            <li>
                Running
            </li>
            <li>
                Basketball
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <u style="font-size: 18px">Professional Associations</u><br>
        In regards to professional associations, I do not have much experience with them. I am interested in the
        Automation career path, so perhaps
        I could be a part of an Automation association further down the line.

        <br>
        <br>
        <u style="font-size: 18px">Clubs</u><br>
        So far, ever since elementary school I have not joined a club. I never saw the appeal to joining a club since
        I am not a very social person. I have however joined a swim team throughout highschool, and during that time I
        made
        provincial standards.
