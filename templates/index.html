        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <hr>
        <u style="font-size: 18px">Hobbies</u><br>
        One of my hobbies that I like to do in my free time is to exercise.
        Exercising is any physical activity that is planned, structured, and</br> repetitive,
        with the goal of improving or maintaining physical fitness, health, or overall well-being.
        Some of my favourite exercises are:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Lift Weights
            </li>
            <li>
                Basketball
            </li>
            <li>
                Soccer
            </li>
            <li>
                Jog
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <u style="font-size: 18px">Interests</u><br>
        Aside from my hobbies, I do have many things that I am interested in. One of the things I am interested in is
        cooking. While I do like to</br> exercise,
        I also like to make food. Here are some of my dishes to make in order:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Garlic Butter Steak and Roasted Potatoes
            </li>
            <li>
                Chicken Carbonara
            </li>
            <li>
                Korean Beef Bulgogi
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <u style="font-size: 18px">Professional Associations</u><br>
        I have no previous experience in with professional associations. I am interested in the
        Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, so perhaps
        I </br>could take part of the International Association for AI and Robotics in Service to Society in the future.

        <br>
        <br>
        <u style="font-size: 18px">Clubs</u><br>
        I have joined a couple of clubs during high school, but did not feel the need to join one in university.
        I was in the athletic club and math </br>club because I really enjoyed math in high school.
